# British Parliment Simulator
## A (kind of) realistic parliment simulator coded in Python

### Running
To start the game, simply open command prompt in the repo directory and run this command:
`py -3 main.py`

### Gameplay
When the simulator starts, you will be greeted with a splash screen, then a main menu. To make a save, simply press 6 (create save) then enter. To load that save, press 1 (play) then enter. Press 1 then enter and the game should start. First, you will be shown info about your save to verify it is correct. Press Y then you will be prompted with a randomly generated question. After 3 seconds, the results will be showed as well as what everyone voted. This cycle will repeat 10 times, then the game will exit and export to the file 'output.csv'
